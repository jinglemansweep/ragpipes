Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Key features of Python include:
- Simple and readable syntax
- Dynamic typing
- Automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Large ecosystem of third-party packages
